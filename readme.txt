== Beta Testers Needed ==

I really want EDD Retroactive Licensing and EDD Retroactive Licensing Premium to be the best WordPress plugins of their type. However, it's beyond me to do it alone.

I need beta testers to help with ensuring pending releases of EDD Retroactive Licensing and EDD Retroactive Licensing Premium are solid. This would benefit us all by helping reduce the number of releases and raise code quality.

[Please contact me directly](http://aihr.us/contact-aihrus/).

Beta testers benefit directly with latest versions, a free 1-site license for EDD Retroactive Licensing Premium, and personalized support assistance.
